title: Kickstating "Ben's Untitled Blog"

Whew! I finally got around to setting up a blog. So, welcome to my brand new
blog I guess.

# Why?

One of the items in my new year's resolution for 2023 is to maintain a blog.
"Why?" you may ask. Well, I often have these (mostly useless) thoughts about
various things which I feel might be of interest to others. Oddly specific
things like my thoughts about voting systems, mixing faucet design, and monopoly
in the film industry and more generalized things like cooking, maths (that's
maths with an "s", mind you!), physics, and of course computers.

Yes I know, new year's resolutions are kinda dumb. There's no real difference
1st January and say 17th May in each year. The Earth completes a revolution
around its orbit on both days. What differs is the starting point for both the
revolutions - a starting point decided by humans. So if you want to change
something about yourself, **start now** not on the 1st of Jan, 
[14th April](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishu), 
[15th September](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosh_Hashanah) or similar. This
is common sense which we all ignore all time, so you're no better a hypocrite
than me. Maybe I should use [CGP Grey's "Themes"](https://youtu.be/NVGuFdX5guE),
but what the hell. I have a new year's resolution, and it includes maintaing a
blog.

# My commitment

A resolution is useless without a clear promise or commitment stating what I'm
going to stick to. I also have to keep my promise, but let's not get ahead
of ourselves here - we don't have that statement yet.

So here are the rules:

## Rule 1

> I have to write *at least* 1 blog every month.

Bonus points for more than a single blog on a month. This means I got to have at
least 12 blogs from 2023 on 1st January 2024.

## Rule 2

> I can skip a month's blog if I compensate it on the preceeding or following month.

Since I get very busy on certain months, but relatively free on others, I want
to be able prioritize my work properly. I don't want to spend precious time on a
busy month writing a poor, hurried blog, nor waste time on a free month for the
sake of a resolution.

## Rule 3

> I have to maintain a certain writing quality and originality.

I once tried to maintain a blog. It was a disaster. Back then, I had no clue how
to use my static site generator (Jekyll), git and honestly my entire computer properly.
My git log was long, and incomprehensible. My Jekyll configuration was a mess. I
forked my theme instead of using the gem, making updating and switching the
theme impossible.

To top all that, my content was primarily tutorials for things that already had
better guides than mine. Plus my English was pathetic. Even though I am a fluent,
native English speaker, I often wrote in poor English, in a similar writing
style used in the posts I read. I wrote a lot of convoluted, college style
sentences even though clear, concise and crisp sentences were better. So no
tutorials in this blog unless what I was doing was revolutionarily different
from what's already on the internet!

## Rule 4

> I have to cover a range of topics that will interest a wide audience.

You could consider this rule an extension of rule 3. You could write a series of
quality, and original blogs on certain Emacs packages and still not have a great
blog. I feel that this blog should reflect me as a person, and though Computer
Science is very important to me, I much more than just a Computer Science geek.
I like to cook (considering whatever cooking skill I have). I love to read. I
have strong thoughts about politics. I like to talk about my music taste. I
think that this blog should address all my interests and not just my love for
CS. As a result it should attract a wide audience (i.e. large numbers), which is
how I plan to check if I have followed this rule well enough.

# From whence the title?

I spent a few minutes thinking of a good title. Since I was too lazy to come up
a clever title, I took inspiration from [Untitled Goose Game](https://goose.game/) 
and settle for "Ben's Untitled Blog". If I do come up with a more geeky name, I
will definitely change the title. So stay "tuned" for that.

# My Stack

For those of you who are curious about my stack, this is a Hugo site. I've got
plugin support with hugo modules, using which I installed my theme. As of right
now I've temporarily set [Hyde](https://github.com/spf13/hyde) as my theme, but
I'm actively searching for a better theme.
